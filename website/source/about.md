## Goal of this website ðŸŽ¯

I want to use this website as a way to document my research and consolidate my understanding of them. Also, I hope that sharing my research and reflections could help others. I can't guarantee that I will regularly update the website, as it will depend on my free time and motivation.

## How to contribute ðŸ”¨

The first option is to contribute to the [Syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TQdDSg5UxOTd921etxHpi26TO-_0fW9X4wm_19ZiI5o/edit?usp=sharing) directly. In this case, you can create a comment to describe any topics that is not contemplated or make any comments you want to share.

Another option is directly contributing in the [github repository](https://github.com/AlbertoFDR/web-security-class) creating an issue.
