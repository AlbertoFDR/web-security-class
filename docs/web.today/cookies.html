  <i>Have you ever visited an online store, added a few items to your cart, then closed your browser, only to return later and find that your items are still there waiting for you? Or maybe you've logged into a website and noticed that you're already signed in, without having to enter your credentials again.</i> All of these conveniences are made possible by a technology called cookies. In this article, we'll explore the fascinating world of <b>HTTP cookies</b>.
  </p>

<h1 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1><div class="column" title="Cookie Definition">

        "Cookies are a general mechanism which server side connections (such as CGI scripts) can use to both store and retrieve information on the client side of the connection. The addition of a simple, persistent, client-side state significantly extends the capabilities of Web-based client/server applications."
        </i>
        <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href='https://web.archive.org/web/20020803110822/wp.netscape.com/newsref/std/cookie_spec.html'>Netscape Proposal (First Cookie proposal)</a>.
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The simplest definition of cookies is that they are an identifier generated by the server, which enables the server to recognize the user among other users. There are a few RFC documents for the standard formalization of cookies (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2109">RFC 1997 oldest</a>)(<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6265.html">RFC 2011 latest</a>). The term ‘User-Agent’ is used in the RFC to refer to the browser. In the following picture I present a basic example of the use of cookie:</p>
<p><img src="/web-security-class/web-security-class/advanced/web.tracking/cookie.svg" alt="cookie"></p>
<div class="column" title="Cookie Definition">
  <div style="overflow: hidden">
    <div style="float: left;">
      <i>
         "...It remembers <b>stateful</b> information for the <b>stateless HTTP protocol</b>."
        </i>
        <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies'>Mozilla Web Docs.</a>.

<p>The primary purpose of cookie management is to facilitate various functions on a website, such as session management (e.g. shopping cart), preferences (e.g. dark-light theme), and tracking user behavior.</p>
<h2 id="Third-party-resources"><a href="#Third-party-resources" class="headerlink" title="Third-party resources"></a>Third-party resources</h2><p>What happens if the webpage that you visit imports a third-party resource? The browser would request these resources from the third-party. If it is the first time you are requesting that endpoint, it could happen that the endpoint returns a Set-Cookie header. If it is not the first time, the browser will request the resource using the cookie for that third-party domain, if any. Let’s take the previous example, but this time imagine that it imports an image from a third-party:</p>
<p><img src="/web-security-class/web-security-class/advanced/web.tracking/third-party-resource.svg" alt="cookie"></p>
<h1 id="Baking-a-Cookie"><a href="#Baking-a-Cookie" class="headerlink" title="Baking a Cookie"></a>Baking a Cookie</h1><p>As depicted in the preceding images, two keys have been incorporated into the HTTP protocol for cookies: <code>set-cookie</code> and <code>cookie</code>. If you prefer, you can read the RFC for the specification (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6265.html">link</a>). </p>
<h4 id="Set-Cookie"><a href="#Set-Cookie" class="headerlink" title="Set-Cookie"></a>Set-Cookie</h4><p>As demonstrated in the picture, the <code>Set-Cookie</code> header is a mechanism used by the server to inform the user’s browser of a specific cookie that should be stored and sent in subsequent requests to the server. This header is included in the server’s response to the user’s initial request, and contains information about the cookie’s name, value, expiration time, path, and other optional attributes. Once the browser receives this header, it stores the cookie locally and sends it back to the server in all subsequent requests to the same domain. For further read of this header or any existing header I recommend (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie">Mozilla Web Docs</a>). The syntax of this header is the following one: </p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">// Reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie</span><br><span class="line">Set-Cookie: &lt;cookie-name&gt;=&lt;cookie-value&gt;</span><br><span class="line">Set-Cookie: &lt;cookie-name&gt;=&lt;cookie-value&gt;; &lt;option&gt;</span><br><span class="line">Set-Cookie: &lt;cookie-name&gt;=&lt;cookie-value&gt;; Domain=&lt;domain-value&gt;; Secure; HttpOnly</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>All of the <code>set-cookie</code> options are important but we are going to focus in some of them. If you want to check all the headers (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie">Mozilla Docs</a>). One important option is <code>HttpOnly</code> which disables any interacion with cookies from the javascript. Suppose you discover a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in a webpage. This vulnerability grants you the ability to execute your JavaScript code on the client-side. If the <code>HttpOnly</code> header has not been set, you can extract the admin’s cookie if they access the URL with the XSS using <code>document.cookie</code> in javascript. You can then use the cookie to login as the admin. <strong>Warning:</strong> Setting the HttpOnly header doesn’t mean that the cookie will not be included in the request made by JavaScript (e.g., fetch). For this issue (CSRF attacks), <code>SameSite</code> header exist. This header defines if the header could be send from other origins. For this header, I recommend another <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie/SameSite">post from Mozilla Web Docs</a>.</p>
<h4 id="Cookie"><a href="#Cookie" class="headerlink" title="Cookie"></a>Cookie</h4><p><code>Cookie</code> header is the header where the cookie is send in the user requests, after been created (<code>set-cookie</code> or javascript). The syntax for this header is:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">// Reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cookie</span><br><span class="line">Cookie: &lt;cookie-list&gt;</span><br><span class="line">Cookie: name=value</span><br><span class="line">Cookie: name=value; name2=value2; name3=value3</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<h4 id="Document-cookie-Javascript"><a href="#Document-cookie-Javascript" class="headerlink" title="Document.cookie (Javascript)"></a>Document.cookie (Javascript)</h4><p>JavaScript provides functionality for reading and writing cookies.</p>
<figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">// You can try this logic using the console of the browser inspector</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// Read</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// Will return all the cookies (if HttpOnly is not enable)</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">let</span> cookies = <span class="variable language_">document</span>.<span class="property">cookie</span>;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// Write</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="variable language_">document</span>.<span class="property">cookie</span> = <span class="string">&quot;user=babyyoda; path=/&quot;</span>;<span class="string">&quot;</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<h1 id="Privacy-issues"><a href="#Privacy-issues" class="headerlink" title="Privacy issues"></a>Privacy issues</h1><p>As the reader may notice, cookies can be used to track a user across different websites. Some of these issues are briefly mentioned in the RFCs. As example, one mitigation for third-party tracking is to block the use of third-party cookies.

<h1 id="Historical-Notes"><a href="#Historical-Notes" class="headerlink" title="Historical Notes"></a>Historical Notes</h1><div class="column" title="RFC 1997">

      "This specification is an amalgam of Kristol's State-Info proposal and Netscape's Cookie proposal. "  
        </i>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>HTTP Cookies were first proposed in 1994 by Netscape Communications Corporation as a way to maintain stateful sessions between web clients and servers. The original specification was called “Magic Cookies” and was later renamed to “Cookies”. The proposal was later submitted to the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), which is responsible for standardizing Internet protocols.</p>
<div class="column" title="Similar proposal (RFC 1997)">
  <div style="overflow: hidden">
    <div style="float: left;">
      <i>"Brian Behlendorf proposed a Session-ID header that would be user-
   agent-initiated and could be used by an origin server to track
   "clicktrails".  It would not carry any origin-server-defined state,
   however.  Phillip Hallam-Baker has proposed another client-defined
   session ID mechanism for similar purposes.
   While both session IDs and cookies can provide a way to sustain
   stateful sessions, their intended purpose is different, and,
   consequently, the privacy requirements for them are different.  A
   user initiates session IDs to allow servers to track progress through
   them, or to distinguish multiple users on a shared machine.
        "</i>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>


<p>The first version of the HTTP Cookies specification was published in 1997 as RFC 2109, which defined the format of the cookie header that is used to set and send cookies between clients and servers. The original specification included several attributes that can be used to control the behavior of cookies, such as the cookie’s name, value, expiration time, and path.</p>
<p>In 1999, the specification was revised and published as RFC 2965, which added support for more advanced features such as <code>secure</code> cookies, which can only be sent over a secure HTTPS connection, and <code>HttpOnly</code> cookies, which cannot be accessed by client-side scripts.</p>
